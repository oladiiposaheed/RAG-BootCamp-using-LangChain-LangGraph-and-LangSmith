    Django for Backend Development

    🌐 **Django** is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.  
    ⚙️ It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern to separate data, logic, and presentation.  
    🚀 Django comes with built-in features like authentication, admin interface, and URL routing.  
    🛡️ It emphasizes security, helping developers avoid common threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.  
    📦 With its "batteries-included" philosophy, Django provides everything needed to build full-stack web apps.  
    🔍 It's widely used for content management systems, social networks, and scientific platforms.  
    🌍 Django powers popular sites like Instagram, Pinterest, and Mozilla.
