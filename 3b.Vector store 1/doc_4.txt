    Introduction to Deep Learning

    🧠 **Deep Learning** is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.  
    🔗 These layers mimic the human brain’s structure, enabling systems to learn hierarchical representations.  
    📚 It excels at tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech translation.  
    🧪 Deep learning models require large datasets and powerful computing resources to train effectively.  
    🕸️ Popular architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).  
    🛠️ Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are commonly used to build deep learning applications.  
    🚀 Deep learning drives innovations in autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and generative AI.
