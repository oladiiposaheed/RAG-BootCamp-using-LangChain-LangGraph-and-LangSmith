    Introduction to Machine Learning

    🤖 **Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  
    📈 It uses algorithms to identify patterns, make predictions, or improve performance over time.  
    🧠 ML models are trained on datasets and adjust themselves based on feedback or new inputs.  
    🔍 Common types include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.  
    💬 Applications range from speech recognition and spam filtering to fraud detection and self-driving cars.  
    🛠️ Tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn are popular in ML development.  
    🌍 ML is transforming industries by automating decisions and uncovering insights from big data.
